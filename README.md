# InspiHER

*InspriHER* is a project created for the [Superposition V hackathon](https://superposition.tech/hackathon.html). ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veneta13/sp-v/main/img/logo.png)

## Our mission is to **educate, empower, and elevate**. 

We asked ourselves these questions: <br/>
💻What issues are women and minority facing within the STEM field? <br/> 
🤝How can we ensure equity within our organization? <br/>
🌱What resources do we provide that are different from any other? 

The issues begin early on, even from the first years in a classroom. That is what *InspiHER* aims to solve - we want to combat the education gap through female empowerment and inclusivity. **Representation** is key, as encouraging people from diverse backgrounds to be involved in STEM creates more opportunities and lights the pathway for future leaders.
