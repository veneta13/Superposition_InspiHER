# InspiHER

*InspriHER* is a project created for the Superposition V hackathon. ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veneta13/sp-v/main/img/logo.png)

## Our mission is to **educate, empower, and elevate**. 

We asked ourselves these questions: 
*What issues are women and minority facing within the STEM field? 
*How can we ensure equity within our organization? 
*What resources do we provide that are different from any other? 

This issue begins early on, even from the first years in a classroom. That is what *InspiHER* aims to solve- we want to combat the education gap through female empowerment and inclusivity. Representation is key, as encouraging people from diverse backgrounds to be involved in STEM creates more opportunities and lights the pathway for future leaders.
